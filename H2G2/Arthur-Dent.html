    Arthur Philip Dent was the hapless human who found himself thrown upon wild adventures around the Universe. With Ford Prefect, his friend of several years, Dent barely escaped the <a href="./?a=4272">Earth</a>'s destruction as it was demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Arthur spent the following several years, still wearing his dressing gown, helplessly launched from crisis to crisis while trying to straighten out his lifestyle.

    He met Ford Prefect, parading as an out of work actor telling everyone he was from Guildford, though he was actually from a planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse. Arthur always wondered about Ford's accent, as it did not match that of a Guildford accent.

    Arthur went to a fancy dress party in Islington dressed as Dr Livingstone. While there he met a woman called Tricia McMillan, who was dressed as Charles Darwin. Tricia wanted to go to Madagascar with Arthur but he shied away from that, suggesting Cornwall instead. <a href="./?a=4336">Zaphod Beeblebrox</a> then turned up, parading as the one-headed "Phil", and convinced Tricia to leave with him.

    After knowing Ford for about five or six years, Ford revealed that he is in fact from Betelguese. Ford knew the Earth was about to be demolished and he planned to save Arthur from being caught up in its destruction.

    He and Ford hitch a ride on a <a href="./?a=4260">Vogon</a> ship, arriving in the washroom of the Vogon flagship. Arthur did not cope well with the hitchhiking and asked for some tea. After Ford introduced him to the travel guide The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and the translating <a href="./?a=4276">Babel Fish</a>, Arthur and
    Ford were captured by a Vogon search party and taken to meet the captain, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz. Jeltz read the two hitchhikers a copy of his <a href="./?a=4264">poetry</a> and then threatening to throw them out into space if they did not tell him what they thought of his poetry. Arthur tried to compliment
    Jeltz's work but Jeltz saw through his effort, ordering Arthur and Ford to be thrown out of airlock number three.
