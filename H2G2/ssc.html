    The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation is the primary manufacturer and supplier of androids, <a href="./?a=4292">robots</a> and autonomic assistants for the known universe. They are known for their catchy jingles and catchphrases, supplied by their Marketing Department.

    Their primary claim to fame seems to be constructing just about everything with (unstable) advanced robotics and software. From doors, to lifts, to toaster ovens, drinks machines, vacuum cleaners, and "personal massage units" -- Everything has been built with a full <a href="./?a=4320">GPP or Genuine People Personality</a>. This means that even a set of airlock doors has emotions, hopes, dreams, intelligence, and worse of all, the capacity for boredom. It should come as no surprise then, that the majority of these devices have a neurotic streak a mile wide.

    The company motto is; "Share and Enjoy." This is widely adaptable, from synthesized drinks to the company of a robot, or 'Your plastic pal who's fun to be with' as it is described by the aforementioned Marketing Department. It should be noted that many who do not Enjoy, then go on to fail to Share,
    unless this includes sharing strongly-worded opinions toward their complaints department.

    Curiously, an edition of the Encyclopedia Galactica which conveniently fell through a rift in the time-space continuum from 1000 years in the future describes the Marketing Department of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation as:

    "A bunch of mindless jerks who were the first against the wall when the revolution came."
