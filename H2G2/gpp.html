    The <a href="./?a=4296">Sirius Cybernetics Corporation</a> invented a concept called Genuine People Personalities ("GPP") which imbue their products with intelligence and emotion.

    Thus not only do doors open and close, but they thank their users for using them, or sigh with the satisfaction of a job well done.

    Other examples of Sirius Cybernetics Corporation's record with sentient technology include an armada of neurotic elevators, hyperactive ships' computers and perhaps most famously of all, Marvin the Paranoid Android.

    Marvin is a prototype for the GPP feature, and his depression and "terrible pain in all the diodes down his left side" are due to unresolved flaws in his programming.
