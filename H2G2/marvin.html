    Marvin, more fully known as Marvin the Paranoid Android, is an incredibly brilliant but overwhelmingly depressed <a href="./?a=4292">robot</a> manufactured by the <a href="./?a=4296">Sirius Cybernetics Corporation</a> an unwilling servant to the crew of the <a href="./?a=4316">Heart of Gold</a>.

  <p>
    Marvin the robot has a prototype version of the <a href="./?a=4320">Genuine People Personality (GPP)</a> software from SCC, allowing him sentience and the ability to feel emotions and develop a personality. He's also incredibly smart, having a "brain the size of a planet" capable of computing extremely complex mathematics, as well as solving difficult
    problems and operating high-tech devices. However, despite being so smart, Marvin is typically made to perform menial tasks and labor such as escorting people, opening doors, picking up pieces of paper, and other tasks well beneath his skills. Even extremely hard tasks, such as computing for the vast
    Krikkit robot army, are trivial for Marvin. All this leaves him extremely bored, frustrated, and overwhelmingly depressed. Because of this, all modern GPP-capable machines, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Eddie_the_Computer" title="Eddie the Computer" style="border: 0px">Eddie</a>
    the computer and the Heart of Gold's automatic doors, are programmed to be extremely cheerful and happy, much to Marvin's disgust.

    Marvin's Lullaby
  </h2>
  <p>
    How I Hate the Night, also known as Marvin's Lullaby, is "a short dolorous ditty of no tone, or indeed tune."
  </p>
  <p>
       Now the world has gone to bed, <br>
       Darkness won't engulf my head, <br>
       I can see by infra-red, <br>
       How I hate the night, <br>
       Now I lay me down to sleep, <br>
       Try to count electric sheep, <br>
       Sweet dream wishes you can keep, <br>
       How I hate the night.
